<p>Inspired by wonderful personal websites, I decided to make my first website as an introduction website for myself.</p>
<p>Those are the websites from which I get motivated:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://yingwendeng.github.io/portfolio/" target="_blank"> Deng Yingwen</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.seanhalpin.design/"  target="_blank">Swan Halpin</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.pascalvangemert.nl/#/profile"  target="_blank">Pascal van Gemert</a></li>
</p>
</div>

<div class = "text">
<p class = "subtitle">17/04/2021</p>
<p>The first challenge for me personally was how to begin. 
    So I decided to review the lecture slides and follow them step by step.</p>
<p>I drew a skech for my ideal homepage and created the html and css files that I needed. I hope I can realize that.</p>
<a target="_blank" href="image/web_skecth.jpg">
    <img class="smaller-image" id = "zoomImage" src="image/web_skecth.jpg" alt="Web Sketch">
  </a>
<p>I found the colors and fonts I would like to have:</p>
<a target="_blank" href="image/web_color.png">
    <img class="smaller-image" src="image/web_color.png" alt="Color Palette">
  </a>
<p>I spent whole day finishing the design of the dairy page. Although the content is to be continued, 
    it's a step for me. I'm already a little bit confused with the code I wrote. Hope I can still understand
    the code tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>I tried to make it possible to enlarge the sketch image on hover with HTML or CSS, but failed. </p>
</div>

<div class = "text">
    <p class = "subtitle">18/04/2021</p>
    <p> I sucessfully created the navigation bar and added the hover effect. The <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp" target="_blank">tutorial from W3Schools</a> 
    helps a lot.</p>
    <p> Now I should start with my homepage. It should be easier after I finally got some experience from the dairy page creation.</p>
    <p> No, it's not. I stucked at designing the layout. I would like to have my background image filled the screen on 
        the first page and when you scoll down, the background will change. I have to learn how to use flexbox.</p>
    <p>I successfully created sections for my first page and also created an animated arrow to indicate scolling down. 
        The realization of animation with css was learned from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/">freecodecamp</a>.
    </p>
    <p>However, I spent too much time on those detail processing. Until 22:00, I still have one section and one page unfinised</p>
    <p>I spent another 3 hours finishing the rest of pages. I did it!</p>
    <p>I would like to thank my friends Yiwei & Zhuo. Without our studying group, I might not be able to finish this website so delightfully.</p>
